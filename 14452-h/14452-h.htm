    <h2>WRESTLING WITH WHISTLERS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Reminiscence of a Recent Exhibition.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Goupil Gallery. Groups of more or
        less puzzled Britons discovered, conscientiously
        endeavouring to do justice to the Collection, having
        realised that</i> Mr. WHISTLER's <i>work is now considered
        entitled to serious consideration, but feeling themselves
        unable to get beyond a timid tolerance. In addition to
        these, there are</i> Frank Philistines <i>who are here with
        a fixed intention of being funny</i>, Matrons <i>with a
        strongly domesticated taste in Art</i>, Serious Elderly
        Ladies, Literal Persons, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>A Lady</i> (<i>after looking at a representation of
        Old Battersea Bridge&mdash;in the tone of a person who
        feels she is making a liberal concession</i>). Well, do you
        know, I must say that <i>isn't</i> so bad. I shouldn't so
        much mind having <i>that</i> in the room, should you?</p>

        <div class="figright"
             style="width:20%;">
            <a href="images/181.png"><img width="100%"
                 src="images/181.png"
                 alt="A Brother Brush." /></a>A Brother Brush.
        </div>

        <p><i>Her Companion</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Well, I don't
        know. He's put a steamer in. Should you think there
        <i>were</i> steamers
        in&mdash;a&mdash;(<i>vaguely</i>)&mdash;those days?</p>

        <p><i>First Lady</i> (<i>evidently considering</i> Mr.
        WHISTLER <i>capable of any eccentricity</i>). Oh, I don't
        suppose he would mind <i>that</i> much.</p>

        <p><i>First Literal Person</i> (<i>coming to the portrait
        of</i> Miss ALEXANDER).
        Well&mdash;(<i>plaintively</i>)&mdash;he <i>might</i> have
        put a nicer expression on the child!</p>

        <p><i>Second Do. Do.</i> Yes&mdash;very unpleasing.
        (<i>Refers to Catalogue</i>.) Oh, I see it says&mdash;"It
        is simply a disagreeable presentment of a disagreeable
        young lady."</p>

        <p><i>First Do. Do.</i> (<i>rejoicing that the painter has
        vindicated himself this time</i>). Ah&mdash;that
        <i>explains</i> it, then. Of course if he <i>meant</i>
        it&mdash;!</p>

        <p><i>A Serious Elderly Lady.</i> There's one thing I must
        say I <i>do</i> like, my dear, and that's the way he puts
        down all the unfavourable criticisms on his pictures. So
        straightforward and honest of him, <i>I</i> call it.</p>

        <p><i>Her Companion.</i> Yes, but I expect he can't help
        seeing how right and sensible the critics are, you know.
        Still&mdash;(<i>charitably</i>)&mdash;it shows he would do
        better if he <i>could</i>!</p>

        <p><i>An Advanced Nephew</i> (<i>who is endeavouring to
        convert a</i> Philistine Uncle <i>to the superiority of the
        Modern School</i>). Now here, Uncle, look at this. Look at
        the way the figure looms out of the canvas, look at the
        learning in the simple sweep of the drapery, the
        <i>drawing</i> of it, and the masterly grace of the
        pose&mdash;you don't mean to tell me you don't call
        <i>that</i> a magnificent portrait?</p>

        <p><i>His Uncle.</i> Who's it of? That's what <i>I</i> want
        to know first.</p>

        <p><i>Nephew</i> (<i>coldly</i>). You will find it in the
        Catalogue, no doubt&mdash;No. 41.</p>

        <p><i>Uncle</i> (<i>looking it up</i>). "<i>Arrangement in
        Black. La Dame au Brodequin Jaune.</i>"&mdash;the lady in a
        yellow something or other. Tchah! And not a word to tell
        you who she's supposed to <i>be</i>? If I pay a shilling
        for a Catalogue, I expect to find information in it. And
        let me ask you&mdash;where's the interest in looking at a
        portrait when you're not told who it's intended for?</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>[<i>The</i> Nephew, <i>not being prepared to answer
            this difficult query, leads his relative gently up to a
            "Nocturne in Opal and Silver." The</i> Uncle <i>conveys
            his opinion of it by a loud and expressive
            snort.</i></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><i>First Prosaic Person</i> (<i>before No. 28</i>).
        Valparaiso, is it? (<i>Hopefully.</i>) Well, come, I
        <i>ought</i> to recognise this&mdash;I've <i>been</i> there
        often enough. (<i>Inspecting it closely.</i>)
        Ha&mdash;um!</p>

        <p><i>Second P.P.</i> (<i>with languid interest</i>). Is it
        <i>like</i>?</p>

        <p><i>First P.P.</i> I could tell you better if he'd done
        it by daylight. I can't make out this in the
        front&mdash;looks to me like the top of a <i>house</i>, or
        something. Don't remember <i>that</i>.</p>

        <p><i>Second P.P.</i> I think it's meant for a jetty,
        landing-stage, or that sort of thing, and, when you look
        <i>into</i> it, there's something that seems intended for
        people&mdash;<i>most</i> extraordinary, isn't it?</p>

        <p><i>The Domesticated Matron</i> (<i>who is searching for
        a picture with a subject to it</i>). There, CAROLINE, it's
        evidently a <i>harbour</i>, you see, and ships, and they're
        letting off fireworks&mdash;probably for a regatta, Does it
        tell you what it is in the Catalogue?</p>

        <p><i>Caroline</i> (<i>after consulting it</i>). It only
        says, "<i>A Nocturne in Blue and Gold</i>"&mdash;oh
        yes&mdash;(<i>reading</i>)&mdash;"a splash and splutter of
        brightness, on a black ground, to depict a display of
        fireworks."</p>

        <p><i>Her Mother</i> (<i>gratified at her own
        intelligence</i>). I thought it <i>must</i> be fireworks.
        He seems quite <i>fond</i> of fireworks, doesn't he?</p>

        <p><i>First Facetious Philistine.</i> Hullo, what have we
        got here? "<i>Crepuscule, in Flesh-colour and Green.</i>"
        Very <i>like</i> one, too, daresay&mdash;when you know what
        it is.</p>

        <p><i>Second F.P.</i> As far as I can make it out, a
        Crepuscule's either a Harmony inside out, or a Symphony
        upside down&mdash;it don't much matter.</p>

        <p><i>A Lady</i> (<i>who is laboriously trying to catch the
        right spirit</i>). "<i>The Blue Wave at Biarritz</i>." Now
        I <i>do</i> admire that. And what I like even better than
        the Blue wave is this great Brown one breaking in the
        foreground&mdash;so exactly <i>like</i> water, isn't it,
        DICK?</p>

        <p><i>Dick</i> (<i>not a Whistlerite</i>).
        Y&mdash;yes&mdash;just. Only it's a rock, you know.</p>

        <p><i>The Lady.</i> But if that's the way he <i>saw</i> it,
        DICK!</p>

        <p><i>Dick.</i> Here's a thing! "<i>St. Mark's,
        Venice</i>." I'll <i>trouble</i> you! What's he done with
        the flagstaffs and the bronze horses and the pigeons?
        <i>I</i> never saw the place look like that.</p>

        <p><i>The Lady.</i> Because it didn't happen to be
        <i>foggy</i> while we were there, that's all.</p>

        <p><i>First Pros. Person.</i> Ah, there's old CARLYLE, you
        see! Dear me, what a very badly fitting coat&mdash;see how
        it bulges over his chest!</p>

        <p><i>Second P.P.</i> Yes. I daresay he buttoned the wrong
        button&mdash;philosopher and all that sort o' thing,
        y'know.</p>

        <p><i>First P.P.</i> (<i>sympathetically</i>). Well, I
        <i>do</i> think WHISTLER might have <i>told</i> him of
        it!</p>

        <h4>IN THE SECOND ROOM.</h4>

        <p><i>The Matron in Search of a Subject.</i> Ah, now, this
        really is more <i>my</i> idea of a picture. Quite a pretty
        <i>crétonne</i> those curtains, and there's a little girl
        reading a book, and a looking-glass with reflections and
        all, and a young lady in a riding-habit&mdash;just going
        out for a ride.</p>

        <p><i>Caroline.</i> Yes. Mother. Or just come in from
        one.</p>

        <p><i>Her Mother.</i> Do see what it's called. "<i>The
        Morning Canter</i>" or "<i>Back from the
        Row</i>"&mdash;something of that kind, I <i>expect</i> it
        would be.</p>

        <p><i>Caroline.</i> All it says is, "<i>A Harmony in Green
        and Rose</i>."</p>

        <p><i>The Mother</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). Now, why can't
        he give it some <i>sensible</i> name, instead of taking
        away all one's interest!</p>

        <p><i>The Phil. Uncle</i> (<i>whom a succession of
        Symphonies and Harmonies has irritated to the verge of
        fury</i>). Don't talk to me, Sir! Don't tell me any of
        these things are pictures. Look at <i>this</i>&mdash;a
        young woman in an outlandish dress sitting on the
        floor&mdash;on the bare floor!&mdash;in a litter of
        Japanese sketches! And he has the confounded impertinence
        to call it a "<i>Caprice</i>"&mdash;a "<i>Caprice in Purple
        and Gold</i>." <i>I</i>'d purple and gold him, Sir, if I
        had <i>my</i> way! Where's the <i>sense</i> in such things?
        What do they <i>teach</i> you? What <i>story</i> do they
        tell? Where's the <i>human interest</i> in them? Depend
        upon it, Sir, these things are rubbish&mdash;sheer rubbish,
        according to all <i>my</i> notions of Art, and I think
        you'll allow I <i>ought</i> to know something about it?</p>

        <p><i>His Nephew</i> (<i>provoked beyond prudence</i>). You
        certainly ought to know more than <i>that</i>, my dear
        Unc&mdash;Are you going?</p>

        <p><i>The Uncle</i> (<i>grimly</i>). Yes&mdash;to see my
        Solicitor, Sir. (<i>To himself, savagely.</i>) That
        confounded young prig will find he's paid dear enough for
        his precious Whistlers&mdash;if I don't have a fit in the
        cab!</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>[<i>He goes; the</i> Nephew <i>wonders whether his
            attempt at proselytising was quite worth while.</i></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><i>A Seriously Elderly Lady.</i> I've no <i>patience</i>
        with the man. Look at GUTSTAVE DORÉ, now. I'm sure
        <i>he</i> was a beautiful artist, if you <i>like</i>. Did
        <i>he</i> go and call his "<i>Leaving the Prætorium</i>" a
        "Symphony" or a "Harmony," or any nonsense of that kind? Of
        course not&mdash;and yet look at the <i>difference</i>!</p>

        <p><i>An Impressionable Person</i> (<i>carried away by the
        local influence&mdash;to the Man at the wicket,
        blandly</i>). Could you kindly oblige me by exchanging this
        "Note in Black and White" for an "Arrangement in Silver and
        Gold"?</p>

    <h3>PERSONAL PARAGRAPHS.</h3>

    <p>The Rev. No. 354, writing from Dartmoor, requests us to
    inform his numerous friends in Bath and elsewhere that his
    health is much improved by the bracing air, and that he is
    occupied in revising for the press his course of Sermons to the
    Young on the Moral Virtues. He is also anxious to inform his
    creditors that his accounts are now completely in order. It is
    a source of great comfort to him to reflect that he was able to
    obtain considerable sums of money from his friends in Bath,
    before he was obliged to leave that city, and that, with the
    residue of this money, obtained so to speak from PETER, he will
    now have the satisfaction of paying a farthing in the pound to
    PAUL, in other words, to his creditors.</p>

    <p>Mrs. BRINVILLIERS was yesterday visited by her friends. Our
    readers will be glad to know that she is quite well and has
    escaped the influenza epidemic.</p>

    <p>Mr. ST. LEONARDS, with the consent of the Governor, takes
    this opportunity of thanking the friends who have so kindly
    condoled with him on the unavoidable interruption to his long
    and arduous work in the service of his country. He hopes that
    nothing will prevent him from displaying equal zeal in the
    still more arduous labour, which, also for the benefit of his
    country, he is now compelled to undertake for a certain
    period.</p>

    <p>Miss DODGER is still unwell. The HOME SECRETARY has not yet
    sent instructions for a special drawing-room to be fitted up in
    the prison, nor has he, up till now, given any permission for
    Miss DODGER's afternoon receptions, and five o'clock teas. It
    is generally considered that the probability of his doing so,
    without a Special Act of Parliament, is still very remote.</p>

    <h2>THE BOUNDS OF SCIENCE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Fragment from a Fin de Monde Romance.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The Student had read many things, but he had not yet
    considered the subject of Coal. He knew that it was expensive,
    but he had not imagined that there was so little in the world.
    But he at length obtained the requisite knowledge, and set to
    work to put things to-rights. He called upon the Secretary of a
    Transatlantic Ocean Steamer Company, and remonstrated with him
    upon the waste with which the transactions of his institution
    were conducted.</p>

    <p>"You carry your passengers too rapidly," he observed.</p>

    <p>"As how?" asked the Secretary.</p>

    <p>"Why I am given to understand that the power generated by
    the coal gives each person on board your ships a rate of
    progression night and day of twenty-four horses."</p>

    <p>"And, if it does&mdash;what then?"</p>

    <p>"Why, it is too much," returned the Student. "All the coal
    in the world will be exhausted in something like four or five
    hundred years; and so, while there is yet time, I had better go
    somewhere where coal is a secondary consideration. What shall I
    do?"</p>

    <p>And then the Secretary advised the Student to take a ticket
    to the Centre of Africa&mdash;and the Student followed his
    advice. But the day before the boat started, the Student once
    more appeared.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid," said he, "I must ask you for the return of my
    money. I find that it will be useless for me to go to the
    Centre of Africa, as the Sun is about to cease giving
    warmth."</p>

    <p>"Dear me!" cried the Secretary, "I was under the impression
    that the Sun was timed to last about one hundred millions of
    years?"</p>

    <p>"It may have been in the far distant past," returned the
    Student, sadly, "but recent statistics fix the termination of
    the Sun's existence at a much nearer date. There is no doubt
    that the Sun will not last more than four millions of years, or
    five millions at longest. Now give me my money!"</p>

    <p>And (of course) the bullion was promptly returned.</p>

    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. XII.&mdash;TO PLAUSIBILITY.</h3>

    <p>DEAR OLD PLAU,</p>

    <p>Hear you have been seen about again with GENIALITY. Poor
    GENIALITY, it may be admitted, is often something of a fool
    when he is by himself, but when you and he begin to hunt in
    couples, you are a deadly pair. I once knew a St. Bernard
    dog&mdash;you will perceive the analogy by-and-by&mdash;who
    lived on terms of friendship with a Skye terrier. By himself
    <i>Rufus</i> was a mild and inoffensive giant. He adored the
    house-cat, and used to help her, in a ponderous way, with the
    care of her numerous family. Many a time have I seen him
    placidly extended before a fire, while puss used his shaggy
    body as a sleeping box, and once he was observed to help that
    anxious tabby-mother with the toilet of her kittens by licking
    them carefully all over. At every lick of <i>Rufus's</i> huge
    prehensile tongue a kitten was lifted bodily into the air,
    only, however, to descend washed and unharmed to the ground.
    But out of doors, in the society of <i>Flick, Rufus's</i> whole
    nature seemed to change. He became a demon-exterminator of
    cats. Led on by his yelping little friend, he chased them
    fiercely to their last retreats, and, if he caught them,
    masticated them without mercy. Once too, on a morning that had
    been appointed for a big covert-shoot, I noticed this strangely
    assorted pair come into the breakfast-room panting and dirty.
    They were not usually afoot before breakfast. What could their
    condition mean? A flustered keeper arrived shortly afterwards
    and explained everything. "Them two dogs o' yourn, Sir," he
    said, "the big 'un and the little 'un, 'ave run all the coverts
    through. There's not a pheasant left in 'em. They're sailin'
    all over the country."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/184.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/184.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The truth was that <i>Flick</i> had organised the expedition
    with extraordinary secrecy and cunning. He had persuaded
    <i>Rufus</i> to join him, and the result was that we shot forty
    pheasants instead of the three hundred on which we had
    counted.</p>

    <p>Now, my dear PLAU, I merely record this little story, and
    leave you to apply it. But I may remind you of incidents that
    touch you more nearly. Do you remember GORTON? Many years ago
    GORTON went to Oxford with a brilliant reputation. Every
    triumph that the University could confer was held to be within
    his grasp. His contemporaries looked upon him as a marvellous
    being, who was destined to rise to the top of whatever tree he
    felt disposed to climb. He was really a delightful fellow,
    fresh, smiling, expansive, amusing, and his friends all
    worshipped him. Of course he went in for the Hertford. His
    success was certain; it was merely a question as to who should
    be second. On the evening before the examination began, there
    was a strange commotion in GORTON's College. GORTON, who was
    supposed to have been reading hard, was found at about twelve
    o'clock in the quad in his nightgown. He was on all fours, and
    was engaged in eating grass and roaring out ribald snatches of
    Latin songs in a shrill voice. When the porter approached him
    he said he was a hippogriff, and that in another ten minutes he
    intended to fly to Iffley and back in half a second. He was
    carried up to bed raving horribly. On the following day he grew
    calmer, and in a week he was himself again. But by that time,
    of course, the examination was over, and DUBBIN was soon
    afterwards announced as the successful competitor.</p>

    <p>Judging the past by what I know now, I cannot doubt that the
    madness of GORTON was what patrons of the prize-ring call a
    put-up job, for he never afterwards showed the smallest symptom
    of lunacy. He had not worked sufficiently, and knew he must
    fail. So he became temporarily insane, to avoid defeat and
    maintain his reputation for scholarship. He left Oxford without
    taking a degree, and owing money right and left&mdash;to
    tradesmen, to his friends, to his tutor. Then he disappeared
    for some years.</p>

    <p>Next he suddenly cropped up again in Ireland. A small
    borough constituency had been suddenly declared vacant. GORTON
    happened to be staying in the hotel. He promptly offered
    himself as a candidate, and plunged with extraordinary vigour
    into the contest. The way that man fooled a simple-hearted
    Irish electorate was marvellous. They came to believe him to be
    a millionnaire, a king of finance, a personage at whose nod
    Statesmen trembled, a being who mingled with all that was
    highest and best in the land. He cajoled them, he flattered
    them, he talked them round his little finger, he rollicked with
    them, opened golden vistas of promise to everyone of them,
    smiled at their wives, defied the Lord Lieutenant, and was
    elected by a crushing majority over a native pork-merchant who
    had nothing but his straightforward honesty to commend him. Of
    course there was a petition, and equally of course GORTON was
    unseated. Then came the reckoning. GORTON had apparently
    intimated that two of the great London political Clubs were so
    warmly interested in his candidature as to have undertaken to
    pay all his expenses. But when application was made to these
    institutions, their secretaries professed a complete and
    chilling ignorance of GORTON, and the deputation from
    Ballywhacket, which had gone to London in search of gold, had
    to return empty-handed to their native place, after wasting a
    varied stock of full-flavoured Irish denunciation on the London
    pavements. But GORTON was undaunted. He actually published an
    address in which he lashed the hateful ingratitude of men who
    betrayed their friends with golden words, and abandoned them
    shamefully in the hour of defeat. But never, so he said, would
    he abandon the betrayed electors of Ballywhacket. Others might
    shuffle, and cheat and cozen, but he might be counted upon to
    remain firm, faithful, and incorruptible amidst the seething
    waves of political turpitude.</p>

    <p>Having issued this, he vanished again, and was heard of no
    more for six or seven years. Then he gradually began to emerge
    again. He was engaged in the completion of an immense work of
    genealogical research, which was intended to cast an entirely
    new light on many obscure incidents of English history. For
    this he solicited encouragement&mdash;and subscriptions. He
    enclosed with his appeals some specimen pages, which appeared
    to promise marvels of industry and research. His preface was a
    wonderful essay, of which a HAYWARD would scarcely have been
    ashamed. In this way he gathered a large amount of money from
    historical enthusiasts with more ardour than knowledge, and
    from old friends who, knowing his real ability, believed that
    he had at last determined to justify the opinions of him which
    they had always held and expressed. It is unnecessary to add
    that not another line was written. For several years ill health
    was supposed to hinder him. We read piteous stories of his
    struggles against the agonies of neuralgia and rheumatics, some
    of us threw good money after bad in the effort to relieve the
    imaginary sufferer; but to this day the proofs of PERKIN
    WARBECK's absolute claim to the throne, and of JACK CADE's
    indubitable royal descent remain in the scheming brain of
    GORTON. Eventually the poor wretch did die in penury, but over
    that part of his story I need not linger. The irony of fate
    ordained that when he was actually in want he should wish to be
    thought in possession of a large income.</p>

    <p>I knew a Clergyman once&mdash;at least I had every reason to
    believe him to be a lawfully ordained Minister of the Church of
    England. He was taken on as temporary Curate in a remote
    district. His life, while he remained there, was exemplary. He
    was untiring in good works; the poor adored him, the well-to-do
    honoured him. We all thought him a pattern of unselfish and
    almost primitive saintliness, and when he departed from us he
    went with a silver inkstand, a dining-room clock and a purse of
    sovereigns, subscribed for by the parish. The odour of his
    sanctity had scarcely evaporated before we discovered, with
    horror, that the man had never been ordained at all! He was an
    impostor, masquerading under an assumed name, but while he was
    with us he did good and lived a flawless life. These matters
    puzzle me. Perhaps you, my dear PLAU, can explain.</p>

    <p>All who are interested in the theatrical celebrities of past
    times will do well to read a brief, indeed, a too brief paper,
    about DOROTHY JORDAN, written by FITZGERALD MOLLOY, for <i>The
    English Illustrated Magazine</i> of this month. The Baron does
    not remember if THACKERAY touched on the story of this talented
    Actress in his Lectures on "<i>The Four Georges</i>;" but the
    sad finish to the brilliant career of Mrs. JORDAN could hardly
    have escaped the great Satirist as being one instance, among
    many, illustrating the wise King's advice as to "not putting
    your trust in Princes;" "or," for the matter of that, and in
    fairness, it must be added, "in any child of man." Poor
    DOROTHY, or DOLLY JORDAN! but now a Queen of "Puppets," and
    now&mdash;thus, a mere rag-dolly. Ah, CLARENCE!&mdash;"False,
    fleeting, perjured CLARENCE!" as SHAKSPEARE wrote of that other
    Duke in Crookback'd RICHARD's time, for whom the "ifs" and
    "ands" of life were resolved for ever in a final "butt."</p>

    <p>In the issue for 1891 of that most interesting yearly
    Annual, <i>The Book-Worm</i>, for which the Baron, taking it up
    now and again, blesses ELLIOT STOCK, of Paternoster Row, there
    is a brief but interesting account of <i>The Annexed
    Prayer-Book</i>, which, after some curious chances and changes,
    was at last ordered to be photographed page by page, without
    being removed from the custody of Black Rod. "By means of an
    elaborate system of reflecting," the process of photographing
    was carried on in the House of Lords. It is satisfactory to all
    Book-worms to know that so important a work was not undertaken
    without even more than the usual amount of reflection.</p>

    <h2>THE HAMLET IN THE HAYMARKET.</h2>

    <p>With Mr. TREE's impersonation of <i>Hamlet</i> most London
    playgoers are by this time acquainted, though not yet familiar.
    It is a most interesting performance, especially to those who
    remember the inauguration of startling new departures by
    CHARLES FECHTER. The question for every fresh <i>Hamlet</i>
    must always be, "How can I differentiate my <i>Hamlet</i> from
    all previous <i>Hamlets</i>? What can I do that nobody has as
    yet thought of doing?" "To be or not to be" <i>Hamlet</i>,
    "that is the question"; whether 'tis better continuously to
    suffer the tortures of uncertainty as to what you might have
    achieved had you essayed the part, or to take up the study of
    it, and ceasing to shiver on the bank, leave off your damnable
    faces, and plunge in? Mr. TREE has plunged, and is going on
    swimmingly.</p>

    <p>Mrs. TREE's <i>Ophelia</i> sane, is charming. Her distraught
    <i>Ophelia</i> is very mad indeed, and her method in her
    madness is excellent.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/185-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/185-2.png"
             alt="'I am thy Father's Ghost!'" /></a>"I am thy
             Father's Ghost!"
    </div>

    <p>There is a curious monotony in some of the stage-business.
    Thus, <i>Ophelia</i> pauses in her exit and comes up quietly
    behind the absent-minded Prince as if to play bo-peep with him:
    then, later on, after his apparently brutal treatment of her,
    <i>Hamlet</i> returns, and, while he is stooping and in tears,
    he kisses her hair and runs away noiselessly as if this also
    were another part of the same game. Then again, in the
    Churchyard, after the scandalous brawling (brought about by the
    stupid ignorance of a dunderheaded ecclesiastic, to whose
    Bishop <i>Laertes</i> ought to have immediately reported him),
    <i>Hamlet</i> returns to weep and throw flowers into the grave.
    Now excellent "returns" are dear to the managerial heart, and
    consoling to his pocket, when they attest the overflowing
    attendance of "friends in front;" but when "returns" are on the
    stage, their excellence may be questioned on the score of
    monotony. Now, as to the Churchyard Scene, permit me to make a
    suggestion:&mdash;the Second Gravedigger has been commissioned
    by the First Gravedigger, with money down, to go to a
    neighbouring publican of the name of YAUGHAN, pronounced Yogan
    or Yawn,&mdash;probably the latter, on account either of his
    opening his mouth wide, or of his being a sleepy-headed
    fellow,&mdash;and fetch a stoop of liquor. Now, when all the
    turmoil is over, the remaining gravedigger would at once set to
    work, as in fact he does in this scene at the Haymarket; but
    here he just shovels a handful of mould into the grave, and
    then, without rhyme or reason (with both of which he has been
    plentifully supplied by SHAKSPEARE), suddenly away he goes,
    merely to allow for the "business" of <i>Hamlet's</i>
    re-entrance. But why shouldn't there be here, prior to the
    return of <i>Hamlet</i>, a re-entrance of the Second
    Gravedigger, as if coming back from friend YAUGHAN's with the
    pot of ale? The sight of this would attract First Gravedigger,
    and take the thirsty soul most readily from his work to discuss
    the refreshment in some shady nook. Then by all means let
    <i>Hamlet</i> return to pour out his grief; and on this picture
    ought the Curtain effectively descend.</p>

    <p>A novel point introduced by Mr. TREE is that his
    <i>Hamlet</i>, entertaining an affectionate remembrance of the
    late YORICK, assumes a friendly and patronising air towards
    YORICK's successor, a Court Fool, apparently so youthful that
    he may still be supposed to be learning his business. So when
    His Royal Highness <i>Hamlet</i> has what he considers "a good
    thing" to say, Mr. TREE places the novice in jesting near
    himself, and pointedly speaks at him; as <i>e.g.</i>, when, in
    reply to the King's inquiry after his health, he tells him that
    he "eats air promise-crammed," adding, with a sly look at the
    Court Fool, "you cannot feed capons so." Whereat the Fool, put
    into a difficult position, through his fear of offending the
    Prince by <i>not</i> laughing, or angering the King (his
    employer) by laughing, has to acknowledge the Prince's
    witticism with a deferential, but somewhat deprecatory,
    snigger.</p>

    <p>Again, when <i>Hamlet</i> is "going to have a lark" with old
    <i>Polonius</i>&mdash;a proceeding in exquisitely bad taste by
    the way&mdash;Mr. TREE's <i>Hamlet</i> attracts the young Court
    Jester's attention to his forthcoming novelty. Now this time,
    as the repartee is about as rude a thing as any vulgar cad of
    an 'ARRY might have uttered, the professional Jester, who
    evidently does not owe his appointment to the Lord
    Chamberlain's favour, and is exempt from his jurisdiction,
    grins all over his countenance, and hops away to explain the
    jest to some of the courtiers, while <i>Hamlet</i> himself, to
    judge by his smiling countenance, is clearly very much pleased
    with his own performance in showing a Jester how the fool
    should be played. And this notion is consistent with the
    character of a Prince who takes upon himself to lecture the
    Actors on their own art. There is no subtler touch in
    SHAKSPEARE's irony than his putting these instructions to
    players in the mouth of a noble amateur. Of the revival, as a
    whole, one may truthfully say, <i>Ça donne à penser</i>, and,
    indeed, the study of <i>Hamlet</i> is inexhaustible.</p>

            <p>But now, when centuries of love and light</p>

            <p>With pestilence-breathing jaws that blackly gape</p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Inspector-General</i> (<i>sharply</i>). Well, Sir!
        (COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF <i>comes briskly to attention</i>.) No,
        your Royal Highness, you can be seated. I don't want to
        disturb you&mdash;much! And now, how is the Easter Review
        getting on?</p>

        <p><i>Com.-in-Chief</i>. First-rate, Sir. Excellent, Sir!
        Couldn't be better, Sir!</p>

        <p><i>Insp.-Gen.</i> (<i>dryly</i>). I have heard those
        phrases before, your Royal Highness&mdash;especially
        "couldn't be better"&mdash;and found subsequently that
        things ought to have been better, very much better,
        Sir.</p>

        <p><i>Com.-in-Chief</i> (<i>anxiously</i>). But I assure
        you, Sir, that this time we are doing our level best. Why,
        Sir, fancy, we are going to have thirty thousand men under
        arms! Think of that, Sir&mdash;thirty thousand men!</p>

        <p><i>Insp.-Gen.</i> About the numbers of a German Brigade,
        or is it a Regiment?</p>

        <p><i>Com.-in-Chief</i> (<i>with a forced laugh</i>). Come,
        Sir, I see you are joking! Yes, thirty thousand men, and
        some of them are going down fully equipped. Why, for
        instance, the Artists will march the whole way to the scene
        of the operations with their own regimental transport! And
        so will the 1st London Engineers. Think of that, Sir!</p>

        <p><i>Insp.-Gen.</i> And how much have you gentlemen here
        had to do with that, Sir? Why, the Volunteers would have
        been left in a state of utter unpreparedness had not the
        public taken the initiative. What did the War Office and
        the Horse Guards do towards giving them their kit?</p>

        <p><i>Com.-in-Chief</i>. Well, it is all right now, Sir.
        And we are going to have a splendid time of it. The idea is
        that a hostile force has landed at Deal during the early
        hours of Monday morning, and&mdash;</p>

        <p><i>Insp.-Gen.</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Yes, I have
        read all that in the papers. But come, tell me who is to
        command?</p>

        <p><i>Com.-in.-Chief</i> (<i>rather taken aback</i>). Well,
        Sir, the customary crew. I suppose BILLY SEYMOUR.</p>

        <p><i>Insp. Gen.</i> (<i>severely</i>). I presume, your
        Royal Highness, that you refer to General Lord WILLIAM
        SEYMOUR, who will be in command at Dover.</p>

        <p><i>Com.-in-Chief</i> (<i>abashed</i>). Certainly, Sir.
        You are a little particular to-day, Sir.</p>

        <p><i>Insp. Gen.</i> (<i>gravely</i>). I am always
        particular&mdash;very particular&mdash;when I have to deal
        with the Volunteers. Well, Sir, General Lord WILLIAM
        SEYMOUR, commands at Dover&mdash;proceed, Sir; pray
        proceed.</p>

        <p><i>Com.-in-Chief</i>. Then, Sir, there's General
        GOODENOUGH at Maidstone, and General DAWSON-SCOTT at
        Chatham.</p>

        <p><i>Insp.-Gen.</i> Is he a Volunteer?</p>

        <p><i>Com.-in-Chief</i> (<i>laughing</i>). Why no, Sir; of
        course not, Sir. Why he's in the Royal Engineers. Although
        in my Crimean days we never considered Sappers soldiers. We
        used to say that&mdash;</p>

    <h2>CONNECTED WITH THE PRESS.</h2>

    <p>At a recent meeting of the Institute of Journalists, it was
    proposed that future candidates for membership should undergo
    an examination to test their qualifications before election.
    Should the proposal be adopted, no doubt some such paper as the
    following will be set to those desirous of obtaining the right
    of adding "M.I.J." to their names.</p>

    <p>1. Would you as a Reporter venture to use such expressions
    as "devouring element" or "destructive fluid" in sending in
    "flimsy" to a London Daily Paper? State when you would consider
    yourself entitled to describe yourself "a Special."</p>

    <p>2. What are the rights of a Journalist at a free luncheon?
    If an Editor finds himself present, should he return thanks for
    the Press himself, or leave that duty in the hands of a
    bumptious Reporter.</p>

    <p>3. Write an essay upon the Law of Libel, and say when a
    paper, (1) should apologise, (2) fight it out, and, (3) settle
    it out of Court.</p>

    <p>4. Define the difference between a "comment of public
    importance" and a "puffing advertisement."</p>

    <p>5. What is "log-rolling?" Give examples to illustrate the
    meaning of the word.</p>

    <p>6. Show, concisely, why the World could not revolve without
    the Press, and why the Press would cease to be without your own
    personal assistance.</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 4.</i>&mdash;ALPHEUS
    CLEOPHAS has added a new terror to Parliamentary life. It is
    bad enough to have him unexpectedly rising from a customary
    seat; usually finds a place on top Bench below Gangway, whence,
    in days that are no more, NEWDEGATE used to lament fresh
    evidences of Papal ascendancy. House grown accustomed to
    hearing the familiar voice from this accustomed spot. To-night,
    conversation on question of Privilege been going forward for
    some time. Seemed about to reach conclusion, when suddenly, far
    below the Gangway in Irish quarter, ominous sound broke on
    startled ear.</p>

    <p>At first all eyes turned to NEWDEGATE's old quarters; but
    the voice evidently did not proceed thence. Following the
    sound, Members came upon ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS breaking out in a
    fresh place. Otherwise, all the same; the flat-toned voice, the
    imperturbable manner that awaits cessation of storm of obloquy,
    and then completes interrupted sentence; the conviction that
    somebody (generally the Government) is acting dishonestly, and
    needs a watchful eye kept upon him; the information conveyed
    that the Eye is now turned on&mdash;all were there, each
    identified ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS. Up again and again during
    preliminary discussion, always shouted at, and ever quietly
    waiting till noise has subsided, when he finishes the
    interrupted sentence, and begins another.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Small
    Holdings.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Happy circumstance in the history of
    all Administrations that there is never lacking a friend on
    their own side to keep them on the right path. RADCLIFFE COOKE
    suddenly developed tendency towards personally conducting the
    Government. Hitherto appeared as a docile follower. New state
    of affairs arose in connection with Breach of Privilege by
    Cambrian Railway Directors. HICKS-BEACH last night gave notice
    to take into consideration Special Report of Select Committee
    charging Directors with Breach of Privilege. BEACH proposed to
    wait awhile till "the other side" had got up a case or two, to
    show that if Masters were prone to punish their Servants for
    giving inconvenient evidence on question of Hours of Labour,
    the Servants were no better when they had power to inflict
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"
       id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span> on each other similar
       punishment. BEACH made his proposal in matter-of-fact way,
       anticipating general concurrence. But CHANNING objected;
       GEORGE TREVELYAN did not approve the suggestion; while the
       SQUIRE OF MALWOOD eagerly seized BEACH's maladroit phrase
       about "the other side," and made great play with it.
       Probably BEACH might have disregarded this action from
       Opposition Benches; but different when RADCLIFFE COOKE rose
       from Bench immediately behind Ministers, and in severely
       judicial manner criticised proposed action of President of
       Board of Trade. BEACH said nothing at moment; after some
       hours' reflection, announced withdrawal of original
       proposition and intention of proceeding with indictment of
       Cambrian Directors without waiting for case of "the other
       side."</p>

    <p>To-day he moved that on Thursday the accused should appear
    at Bar of House. This on point of being agreed to when COOKE
    again appeared on scene; with increased impressiveness of
    manner argued against BEACH's proposal. Prince ARTHUR began to
    look uneasy; no knowing where this sort of thing would end if
    it spread. What with SEXTON on one side correcting grammar of
    Ministerial Resolutions, and RADCLIFFE COOKE on the other
    amending their procedure, it really seemed time to go to the
    country. Something like condition of paralysis stealing over
    Treasury Bench when SPEAKER came to assistance of Ministers,
    and benignly but effectively pointed out to COOKE that he was
    one too many, was in fact spoiling the broth. COOKE tried to
    argue the matter out, but SPEAKER peremptory and Ministers
    saved from fresh rebuff.</p>

    <p>"It's all very well for them arguing round the subject like
    that," said MACLURE, nervously mopping his forehead. "But it's
    a very different thing with me, at my age and fighting weight.
    An Insurance Broker, Director of various Railway and other
    Companies, formerly Major of the 40th Lancashire Volunteers, a
    Trustee for three Church livings, and father of a large family,
    to be brought up on a Breach of Privilege is no slight matter.
    Indignity is aggravated by the locality. 'The Bar' is the last
    place in the world where the friends of JOHN WILLIAM MACLURE
    would think it likely to find him."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee on Small
    Holdings.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday Night.</i>&mdash;After all, MACLURE didn't have
    to stand at the Bar to-night, so his feelings were saved a
    peculiarly painful wrench. But the Chairman of Cambrian Railway
    held a special meeting at Bar. It was attended by Mr. BAILEY
    HAWKINS, and Mr. JOHN CONACHER, Manager of the Company. The
    SERGEANT-AT-ARMS also looked in, bringing the Mace with
    him.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:21%;">
        <a href="images/192-1.png"><img width="100%"

             </a>Turning his Back on his own Resolution.
    </div>

    <p>"Now if they were <i>really</i> going to have anything at
    the Bar," said MACLURE, looking wistfully on, "a drop of mulled
    port or anything like that, Mace would come in handy. Suppose
    ERSKINE would dip it in the jorum and stir the liquor
    round."</p>

    <p>So MACLURE joked, and so, as JULIUS 'ANNIBAL, naturally
    well-posted up in this epoch of history, reminds me, NERO
    fiddled whilst Rome burned. Fact is, MACLURE in terrible funk;
    mental condition shared by his Chairman, Co-director, and the
    Manager. The latter, resolved to sell his life dearly, brought
    in his umbrella, which gave him a quite casual
    hope-I-don't-intrude appearance as he stood at the Bar.</p>

    <p>Members at first disposed to regard whole matter as a joke.
    Cheered MACLURE when he came in at a half trot; laughed when,
    the Bar pulled out, difficulty arose about making both ends
    meet.</p>

    <p>"That's the Chancellor of the Exchequer's duty," said
    WILFRID LAWSON; "GOSCHEN ought to go and lend a hand."</p>

    <p>Bursts of laughter and buzz of conversation in all parts of
    the House; general aspect more like appearance at theatre on
    Boxing Night when audience waits for curtain to rise on new
    pantomime. Only the SPEAKER grave, even solemn; his voice
    occasionally rising above merry din with stern cry of "Order!
    order!"</p>

    <p>"Of course, now they're at the Bar they can order what they
    please," said TANNER. Well the SPEAKER didn't hear him. Later,
    on eve of final division, he offered another remark in louder
    tone. SPEAKER thundered down upon him like a tornado, and
    TANNER quiet for rest of sitting.</p>

    <p>HICKS-BEACH's speech gave new and more serious turn to
    affairs. Concluded with Motion declaring Directors guilty of
    Breach of Privilege and sentencing them to admonition. But
    speech itself clearly made out that Directors were blameless;
    all the bother lying at door of Railway Servant who had been
    dismissed. Speech, in short, turned its back on Resolution.
    This riled the Radicals; not to be soothed even by Mr. G.
    interposing in favourite character as GRAND OLD PACIFICATOR.
    Storm raged all night; division after division taken; finally,
    long past midnight, Directors again brought up to the Bar, the
    worn, almost shrivelled, appearance of CONACHER's umbrella
    testifying to the mental suffering undergone during the seven
    hours that had passed since last they stood there.</p>

    <p>SPEAKER, with awful mien and in terrible tones, "admonished"
    them; and so to bed.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
